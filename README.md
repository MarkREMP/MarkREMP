- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarkREMP
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in Python, C++, C#, JS and also don't mind creating websites in HTML5(CSS). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at Step Academy on a software course.
- 💞️ I’m looking for collaboration with other students. And also perhaps with some professionals who don't mind taking me into their team.
- 📫 How to reach me? Write to me on Instagram(@velkomark) or on Telegram(@alogain)
